<h1>How to use:</h1>

<h2>Log In or Sign Up</h2>
<br>

Before being able to enter the application, the user create a profile (like with Instagram). The user will be greeted with an option to log in to their account if they already have one or register if they do not.

Below, the user can register for an account and have the option to upload a profile pic. However, they do not need to do so in order to create an account. They can always edit their profile pic later. For now, they will have a default avatar.

We will register as a user named "User123".

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss1.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Home Feed</h2>
<br>

The user is now brought to the main home feed. Here, you will see all the picture posts of every user that is registered on the application. It is sorted by the most recent post on the top.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss2.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Nav Bar</h2>
<br>

The nav bar is fixed to the left side of the screen. The user's profile pic is show, along with 5 links to the home page, the user's profile page, search function, notifications list, and a log-out button.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss3.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

Before we start exploring other users' posts and profiles, the user would like to navigate to their own profile page and upload a profile picture and a bio.

To do so, the user click's on the "Profile" link on the nav bar.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss4.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<h2>My Profile</h2>
<br>

The user's profile is pretty blank. There are no posts yet and no activity. The user want's to change that.

The user can click on their profile picture in the center and be brought to a modal where they can upload a picture of themselves.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss5.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

Using base64 image encoding, the user is able to upload a picture of themselves from their local machine onto the application.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss6.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss7.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

The user confirms that this is the picture they want and hits "confirm".

Now, their profile page has a proper picture that way other users can see what they look like.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss8.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

The user can also add a short bio too, using the "Add Bio" feature right below their profile pic.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss9.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Uploading a Pic</h2>
<br>

In order to post their first picture, the user clicks "Post a Pic" at the bottom and now has the ability to upload a picture from their local machine, add a caption, and post it to the general home feed.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss10.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss11.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

After the user confirms their picture and shares, it is now visible in their profile page as well as the home feed.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss12.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss13.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Interacting with other users' posts</h2>
<br>

The user can interact with other users' posts. 

For example, this post by user "Gary" has a picture of London that the user likes. The user will click the heart icon to like the post, and the heart will fill with red color to let the user know that they have already liked the post. The user can click the heart again to unlike it.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss14.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

The user can comment on the post, saying that they wish they could go to London as well.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss15.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

The comment will display in the list of comments for the post.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss16.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Sharing a pic</h2>
<br>

The user can also share this post with another user as well. This user knows the user named "Don", and would like to share this London picture with him.

The user clicks on the arrow button next to the like button and is brought to a modal where they can search for a user to share to.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss17.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

The user can type in the search bar and the search results will automatically find the user based on what is typed in the search bar.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss18.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

After selecting user "Don", we can confirm to share this post with him.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss19.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

Don will now get a notification when he logs in that this post was shared to him, more on that later.

<h2>Search bar feature</h2>
<br>

Like the sharing feature, we can search for a specific user and be brought to their profile via the search bar feature in the nav bar.

The user clicks on it and sees a modal with a list of users of the application.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss20.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

Let's search for a user named "Karen".

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss21.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Profile page</h2>
<br>

The user clicks on her profile and is brought to her profile page.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss22.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

The user sees that Karen has posted a picture of Seattle, which the user likes. The user decides to follow Karen from now on, and also click the picture of Seattle to be brought to the post's page.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss23.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Post page</h2>
<br>

Here, the user can interact with the post the same way they could on the post while it's displayed in the home feed. The user can like, share, comment on the post the same way. They may also delete their own comments on the post if they choose to do so.

The user decides to like the post, comment on it complimenting Karen, and share it to user "Don" too.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss24.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss25.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

Now, the user will log out and return another time, clicking the "Log out" button on the nav bar.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss26.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<br>

To check on the "notifications" feature, let's log into the account of user "Don" and see that he was properly notified of the 2 posts that "User123" has shared with him.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss27.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

As expected, Don is greeted with "New Notifications". He clicks on it and sees his list of all the notifications he's had whenever another user has interacted with his posts or followed.

Also as expected, User123's 2 shared posts are at the top, with the option to click a link to the referenced post, as well as marking the notification as "read" by clicking on the message itself.

<br>
<div align='center'>
    <img src='./screenshots/ss28.png' width=100%/>
</div>
<br>

Now, user "Don" would like to log out and return another time.
